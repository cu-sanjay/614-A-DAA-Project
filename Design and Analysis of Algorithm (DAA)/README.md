## 📝 Definitions

### 🔍 Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes in a systematic manner. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is often used in maze-solving and graph traversal applications.

### 🧩 Maze
A maze is a complex, branching puzzle that includes choices of paths and dead ends. In the context of this project, a maze is represented as a grid of cells, where some cells are walls, and others are open paths.

### 🛣️ Pathfinding
Pathfinding is the process of finding a path from a starting point to a destination point in a maze or graph. Different algorithms, such as DFS and Breadth-First Search (BFS), are used to find the most efficient path.

## 🧠 How It Works

The project employs the DFS algorithm to solve mazes. The DFS algorithm explores the maze, trying to find a path from the start cell to the goal cell. It backtracks when it reaches dead-ends and keeps exploring other paths until it finds a solution.

The DFS solver explores the maze, and after backtracking and exploration, it finds a path to the goal cell.

## 🚶🏾‍♂️Project Details

This project uses the **pyamaze** library to create mazes, visualize the exploration process, and find the path. The code provided in the **src** repository demonstrates how to create a maze, apply the DFS algorithm to solve it, and visualize the results.
